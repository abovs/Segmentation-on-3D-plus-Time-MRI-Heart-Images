For a description of the data and of the image format, see

Requirements:
Python 2.4
OpenCV 2.0
Numpy, scipy pandas and sklearn installed.


How to run:

$ ./slices.sh
$ ./slices_experts.sh
$ python calcula_slices.py > out
$ python estatisticas.py > estat


But you don't acctually need to run the first two steps mainly because all slices are already extracted in this project.
Also the results from calcula_slices.py is already saved for comparison in out.txt.
The same goes for estatisticas.py in the file estatisticas.txt
